# SOLID PRINCIPLES

## Single Responsability 
    Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excesive functionality.

---
## Open-Closed Principle
    Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

    In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.


---
## Liskov Substitution 
   
    Every class or derive class should be substitutable for their base or parent class. 

---
## Interface Segregation 
    Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

---
## Dependency Inversion 
    Components should depend on abstractions not on concretions
